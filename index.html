                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                   Hi, and thanks for taking the time to check out my website. My name is AJ and Iâ€™m a Web Designer. 
                   I specialize in mobile responsive, professional, business and personal websites. I primarily 
                   build my websites with Wordpress, Elementor, and Siteground, but can use whatever combination
                   of tools you have chosen to build your website. You can find links to my portfolio or to 
                   contact me on this page. If you're interested in working together, or not sure about what direction 
                   you should take to build your website, you can schedule a free 15 minute consultation and I can help you get organized and on your way
                   to building your website.
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks,
                    <br><br>
                    AJ

                                My experience with Wordpress allows me to build any website you
                                may need. From e-commerce to blogs nothing is beyond my reach. I 
                                can use handwritten code to design you a custom theme tailor fitted
                                to your specific needs. I've provided links to my portfolio projects 
                                in the navigation above and a couple client projects below.
